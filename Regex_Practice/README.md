## About the practice

Write an R or Python code to validate the passwords below according to the following conditions:

They must contain between 8 and 20 characters (no more, no less).
Must contain at least one uppercase, one lowercase and one number
Must contain at least one of these symbols: !#&
It can contain two times &, or two of these symbols, or three, but cannot contain a $, nor an @, etc. And it is mandatory that it contains at least one**.

Write a code that adds to the next data frame the validation (i.e. a column with True/False or TRUE/FALSE values depending on whether the password is valid or not). Copy your code in the space provided.
